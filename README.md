# portofolio2.0

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is built using a modern, industry-standard technology stack focused on scalability, performance, and long-term maintainability.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

### Framework
- **Next.js 15 (App Router)**  
  Uses the latest App Router architecture with **Server Actions**, eliminating the need for manual API routes for simple CRUD operations and enabling a cleaner backend workflow.

### Language
- **TypeScript**  
  Provides strict type safety to improve reliability, scalability, and ease of maintenance in large codebases.

### Styling
- **Tailwind CSS v4**  
  Powered by a faster, Rust-based compiler, offering high performance and full design flexibility.

### UI Components
- **shadcn/ui**  
  A collection of reusable components copied directly into the codebase, giving full control over styling and behavior without dependency lock-in.

## 🗄️ Backend & Data

### Database
- **PostgreSQL**  
  A robust and reliable relational database suitable for medium to large-scale applications.

### ORM
- **Drizzle ORM**  
  A lightweight, low-latency ORM that generates efficient SQL queries and follows clean architecture principles.

## 🔐 Authentication
- **Auth.js (v5)**  
  The standard authentication solution for Next.js, supporting:
  - Credentials-based authentication
  - OAuth providers (GitHub, Google, etc.)

## 📦 File Storage
- **Uploadthing / AWS S3**  
  Implements best practices by storing files in object storage instead of the database to ensure faster access and better scalability.

## 🎯 Design Principles
- Performance-first architecture
- Type-safe and scalable codebase
- Clean separation of concerns
- Production-ready best practices
